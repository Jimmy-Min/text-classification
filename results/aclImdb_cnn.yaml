      say that is worst film to date. himself seems too old to play the part of acting
      and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall look of the the characters
      seem rushed and around the edges especially character. The acting doesn''t seem
      to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling. The direction is

      are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that
      you couldn''t even get a "Well, I out of the most person out there. It is kind
      of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel
      didn''t work because you had Matthau and Lemmon say quite a few and that just
      doesn''t fit course, now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you
      still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this. I think the only male actor
      in this film who is still alive is John died recently. So there you have it.
      Simply one of the best comedies and films I have just learned recently that
      John has died so to all the fans of him I am deeply sorry. I didn''t mean any

      own ranks doesn''t like to split the but wants to keep it all for himself, even
      when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. But all but one survive
      and they are out for revenge. One year later, in Los Angeles this time, the
      surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold
      and get their revenge on the story on itself is of course not very original,
      since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has plenty of to offer
      to make you forget about that. This is a typical heist / action movie but it

      consists of a series of unlikely information - like some random person lost
      his and someone used his name to buy a car - which is always right on the money.
      since there''s no real plot and the script is so you cant expect any real character
      development, or tension, so instead of creating them through the story, they
      simply add some disconnected dramatic music, which you that something very dramatic
      is going on , instead of actually creating something bottom line is that this
      is a very bad movie, and a complete waste of time which somehow got an incredibly

      and I believe I hadn''t seen the film since my year in high school and I''m
      now in my 4th year of college. Although the film has many flaws, it is just
      so touching that you can''t help but sit down, watch it, and enjoy yourself.
      It is also hilarious. Danny ranting is just so over the top that you can''t

      Rather it''s merely a that''s an extra on the DVD of the movie "The It also
      nowhere near being the 90 minutes that it''s listed here In it''s barely over
